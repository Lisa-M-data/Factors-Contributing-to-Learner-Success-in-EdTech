# Factors Contributing to Learner Success in EdTech Programs
# Exploration: Factors Contributing to Learner Success in EdTech
## Revised Hypothesis:
What factors contribute to learner success in EdTech environments? Specifically, does homework completion, platform engagement, or tutor visits have an impact on average student scores? Additionally, does job type play a role in learner success?


## Findings:

## Homework Completion vs. Average Scores:

There is a very weak correlation (0.0171) between homework completion and average scores.

This suggests that homework completion has minimal impact on average student scores.

## Homework Completion Levels (Low, Medium, High):

High homework completion is associated with slightly higher average scores, but the relationship is not strong enough to make strong conclusions.

## Tutor Visits:

Students who visit tutors tend to have slightly higher average scores.

This suggests that seeking additional support through tutors can positively impact performance.

## Platform Engagement (Desktop Access):

Students who use the platform via desktop have higher average scores.

This may indicate that greater engagement with the platform (often more involved on desktop) correlates with better performance.

## Job Types and Their Impact on Average Scores:

IT professionals lead with the highest average score, followed by Science and Finance professionals.

Job types like Medicine and Education show lower average scores, with Education having the lowest average score.

Project leaders in Science and Finance tend to have slightly higher average scores compared to other fields, suggesting these fields may have skills or experiences better aligned with EdTech platforms.

## Conclusion:

Homework completion has a weak impact on average scores.

Engagement (via tutor visits and desktop access) appears to have a positive effect on learner success.

Certain job types, particularly IT, Science, and Finance, show higher average scores, potentially due to their alignment with the learning platform's requirements or the learners' skill sets.
