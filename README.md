# Project Summary: Exploring EdTech Learner Success Factors 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/podsyp/edtech-students-achievements?select=edtech_data.csv

## Why This Project?
This project aims to analyze learner engagement and performance in an EdTech setting. As online learning platforms grow, understanding what factors contribute to learner success is critical to improving both user experience and educational outcomes. By analyzing data from a large cohort of learners, this project aims to uncover patterns and relationships that can help optimize learning processes and inform program improvements.

In my current role as a Customer Success Coordinator in an EdTech customer-facing role, I work directly with learners to support their educational journeys. This hands-on experience has given me unique insights into what factors impact learner success and the types of challenges learners face. It was this experience that motivated me to dive deeper into the data to explore these factors more systematically.

## Hypothesis
Hypothesis: "Higher engagement with platform resources (such as tutor interactions, homework completion, and desktop use) will positively correlate with better learner performance (higher average scores)."

## Variables

Dependent Variable:

* Average Score – Represents the learner's performance in the program.

Independent Variables:

* Tutor Interaction – Whether the learner has engaged with a tutor or not.

* Homework Completion – The amount of homework completed by the learner.

* Device Used – Whether the learner used a desktop or mobile device to access the platform.


## Job Type – The profession of the learner (e.g., IT, Science, Finance).


## First Visit Date – The month the learner first accessed the platform.

## Platform Engagement – The frequency and method of platform access (e.g., desktop vs mobile).

## Technology Used:
SQL, Google BigQuery 

## Results:
## Platform Engagement:

* Most users accessed the platform in April 2020 (67,670 learners).

* iOS users (56,055) were the largest group, followed by Android users (44,359).

## Tutor Interaction:

* 75,820 learners (61%) did not interact with a tutor, with the rest engaging in various ways.

* There was a slight positive impact on learner success for those interacting with tutors, but it was not overwhelmingly strong.

## Homework Completion:

* Homework completion showed a very weak positive correlation (0.0171) with average scores, suggesting that while there is some association, it’s not significant in terms of performance outcomes.

* Learners with high homework completion had a slightly higher average score (79.24) compared to those with lower homework completion (76.05).

## Device Usage:

* Desktop users had a higher average score (77.78) compared to mobile users (74.54), indicating that device choice might impact performance, with desktop users generally performing better.

Job Type and Learner Success:

* Learners working in IT had the highest average score (80.09), followed by those in Science and Finance. Those categorized as "Unknown" showed average scores of 77.02.

## Conclusions:

Tutor Interaction: While tutor engagement does play a role in learner success, its effect is not as strong as expected. This suggests that other factors, such as study habits or external resources, might have a larger impact on learner success.

* Homework Completion: The weak correlation between homework completion and average scores indicates that simply completing more homework is not a major predictor of success. However, encouraging homework completion could still support learners who are struggling or under-engaged.

* Device Usage: Learners who used desktop devices performed better on average, suggesting that the desktop version of the platform may offer a more conducive learning environment, potentially due to better user interface or functionality.

* Job Type Impact: Learners in certain job fields, particularly IT and Science, showed better performance, possibly due to prior knowledge, skills, or their ability to apply learning to practical contexts.

## Should I Reject My Hypothesis
The hypothesis can be partially supported, but the weak impact of homework completion and the lack of strong correlation between tutor interaction and performance suggest that the hypothesis should be revised. Further analysis might explore other factors influencing success, such as external study habits or intrinsic learner motivation. Therefore, the hypothesis is not entirely rejected, but it requires refinement to account for other variables that contribute to learner success.
